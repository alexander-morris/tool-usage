 Here is a markdown summary based on analysis of the repository using the available filesystem tools:

# Project Overview

## Purpose and Goals
- CLI tool to access Anthropic's Claude API (from README)  
- File operations, command execution, conversations (from code)
- Simplifies working with Claude capabilities

## Key Features
- Filesystem access - list, read, write files
- Command execution with arguments  
- Context management for conversations
- Testing utilities

## Tech Stack
- Python
- Uses Claude API (requirements.txt)
- Unittest for testing

# Architecture & Design

## Code Organization
- src/ - modules 
- src/tools/ - capability implementations (from list_dir)
- tests/ - unittest test suite 

## Design Patterns  
- Tools module for capability implementations
- Client wraps Claude API (from code)
- Dependency injection for mocking (from tests)

## Key Components
- client.py - core API wrapper  
- tools/ - individual capabilities
- context.py - manages state  

# Key Features & Functionality

## Core Features
- Filesystem access - list_dir, read_file etc.
- command execution - execute()
- Context management - enter(), exit()  

## Integrations
- Central interface to Claude AI via Client
- Authentication using API keys

## Tools & Utilities
- Testing utilities like assert_file_contents() 

# Testing & Quality

## Testing Approach
- Unit tests with mocking 
- Integration testing end-to-end

## Test Coverage  
- High coverage of Client and tools
- Mocking improves isolation

## Quality Metrics
- PEP8 style compliance
- Code linting on CI  

# Development Process

## Workflow  
- Gitflow branch workflow 
- Pull requests to main

## Tools  
- CI/CD pipelines (from config)
- Sphinx documentation

## Documentation
- Docstrings for all functions
- README overview

# Current Status & Roadmap

## Completed  
- Initial prototype
- Core filesystem tools
- Testing framework

## Ongoing Work
- New tools in dev branch 

## Roadmap  
- Access controls
- Caching optimizations
