# Command Test Failures and Resolutions

## Initial Issues

1. **Private Method Called Publicly**

   - Issue: `_check_command_security` was being called directly in tests
   - Fix: Made `check_command_security` the public interface that wraps `_check_command_security`
   - Rationale: Better encapsulation and consistent error handling

2. **Shell Metacharacter Detection**

   - Issue: Shell escape pattern was too strict, blocking valid escape sequences
   - Fix: Updated `SHELL_ESCAPE_PATTERNS` to allow `\0`, `\n`, and `\t`
   - Rationale: Common escape sequences needed for normal operation

3. **Protected Environment Variables**

   - Issue: Redundant checking of protected variables in both `_check_command_security` and `execute`
   - Fix: Removed environment variable check from `_check_command_security`, relying on `SecurityContext`
   - Rationale: Single responsibility principle - `SecurityContext` should manage environment variables

4. **Error Message Consistency**
   - Issue: Inconsistent error messages between different security violations
   - Fix: Standardized on generic "Command contains restricted operations" message
   - Rationale: Better security through information hiding

## Test Organization

1. **Permission Tests Migration**

   - Issue: Command permission tests were in a separate file (`test_permissions.py`)
   - Fix: Moved command permission tests to `test_command.py`
   - Rationale: Better organization by keeping tests with their corresponding source files

2. **New Permission Tests**
   - `test_command_in_noaccess_dir`: Verifies proper handling of directory access restrictions
   - `test_command_with_readonly_output`: Tests handling of write permission errors
   - `test_command_with_restricted_env`: Validates environment variable security

## Test Changes

1. **test_check_command_security_env_vars**

   - Before: Expected specific error messages for each type of violation
   - After: Expects generic error message for all security violations
   - Rationale: Consistent with security best practices

2. **test_execute_with_shell** and **test_execute_without_shell**

   - Before: Expected "injection patterns not allowed" message
   - After: Expects generic "Command contains restricted operations" message
   - Rationale: Avoid leaking implementation details

3. **test_sanitize_output**
   - Before: Failed due to strict shell escape pattern blocking `\0`
   - After: Passes with updated escape pattern allowing common control characters
   - Rationale: Support standard text processing operations

## Security Improvements

1. **Error Messages**

   - Standardized on generic error messages
   - Prevents attackers from probing security boundaries
   - Provides consistent user experience

2. **Environment Protection**

   - Centralized in `SecurityContext`
   - More maintainable and consistent
   - Clearer separation of concerns

3. **Command Validation**
   - Improved shell operator handling
   - Better detection of injection attempts in list mode
   - Maintains security while allowing legitimate operations

## Lessons Learned

1. **Security by Design**

   - Generic error messages are better for security
   - Centralize security logic in appropriate components
   - Balance security with usability

2. **Code Organization**

   - Clear separation of concerns between components
   - Public interfaces for testing
   - Consistent error handling patterns

3. **Test Design**
   - Tests should verify behavior, not implementation details
   - Error message assertions should be flexible
   - Security tests should cover both positive and negative cases
