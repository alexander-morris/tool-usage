# Filesystem Test Failures and Resolutions

## Test Organization Changes

1. **Permission Tests Migration**
   - Issue: Permission-related tests were in a separate file (`test_permissions.py`)
   - Fix: Moved filesystem permission tests to `test_filesystem.py`
   - Rationale: Better organization by keeping tests with their corresponding source files

## Permission Test Cases

1. **Read-Only File Operations**

   - Test: `test_write_to_readonly_file`
   - Verifies: Proper error handling when attempting to write to read-only files
   - Ensures: File contents remain unchanged after failed write attempts

2. **No-Access Directory Operations**

   - Test: `test_read_from_noaccess_dir`
   - Test: `test_list_noaccess_dir`
   - Verifies: Proper error handling for directory permission restrictions
   - Ensures: Clear error messages indicating permission issues

3. **Read-Only Directory Operations**

   - Test: `test_create_file_in_readonly_dir`
   - Verifies: Proper error handling when creating files in read-only directories
   - Ensures: Consistent error messages for directory permission issues

4. **Execute Permission Checks**
   - Test: `test_execute_without_permission`
   - Verifies: Proper handling of execute permission checks
   - Ensures: Clear error messages for execute permission violations

## Error Message Consistency

1. **Permission Error Messages**

   - Standard format for file permission errors
   - Includes file path in error messages
   - Clear distinction between different types of permission issues

2. **Error Types**
   - Write permission errors
   - Read permission errors
   - Execute permission errors
   - Directory access errors

## Test Fixtures

1. **Temporary Resources**

   - `temp_dir`: Base temporary directory
   - `read_only_file`: File with read-only permissions
   - `no_access_dir`: Directory with restricted access

2. **Cleanup Handling**
   - Proper permission restoration before cleanup
   - Reliable resource cleanup even after test failures
   - Handles nested directory structures

## Lessons Learned

1. **Test Organization**

   - Group tests by functionality rather than feature type
   - Keep tests close to their implementation files
   - Use clear naming conventions for test files

2. **Permission Testing**

   - Test both positive and negative permission scenarios
   - Verify file/directory state after failed operations
   - Include proper cleanup in fixture teardown

3. **Error Handling**
   - Consistent error message format
   - Include relevant context in error messages
   - Proper exception types for different error cases
