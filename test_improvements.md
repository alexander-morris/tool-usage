# Test Improvements

## Code That Needs to be Changed

### FileSystemTools

1. Fix directory creation in `write_file` method

   - Currently fails when parent directory doesn't exist
   - Should create parent directories before writing file

2. Fix security checks in `check_file_executable`

   - Security check should happen before existence check
   - Should raise SecurityError for paths outside allowed directories

3. Fix path traversal protection in `safe_exists`

   - Currently not properly detecting path traversal attempts
   - Should raise SecurityError for paths trying to escape allowed directories

4. Improve error messages
   - Make error messages more consistent across methods
   - Include "Permission denied" in permission error messages
   - Standardize error message format

### SecurityContext

1. Add validation for workspace paths

   - Add checks for symlinks
   - Add proper handling of relative paths
   - Add pattern matching for restricted paths

2. Add validation for environment variables

   - Add checks for sensitive environment variables
   - Add pattern matching for restricted variable names
   - Add validation of variable values

3. Add pattern matching for restricted commands
   - Improve command pattern matching
   - Add support for complex patterns
   - Add validation of command arguments

## Future Improvements

1. Add comprehensive logging
2. Add cleanup handlers
3. Add performance optimizations
4. Add support for async operations
5. Add support for file locking
6. Add support for file compression
